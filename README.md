> **SQL Efficient Workflow** - MCP server for efficient context sharing between Claude Code sub-agents

## What is sqlew?

**sqlew** is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that gives AI agents organizational memory across sessions.

### The Problem
Without sqlew, every Claude session starts with zero context. You must re-explain decisions, agents can reintroduce bugs, and there's no way to track WHY decisions were made.

It has been possible to keep records using Markdown files. However, large-scale projects or long-term maintenance records tend to generate massive amounts of documentation. This has become a problem, as it causes context rot in AI systems, leading to declining performance.

### The Solution
sqlew builds efficient external memory for AI by using relational databases.
- Records the reasoning behind decisions
- Enables querying past context
- Prevents anti-patterns through constraints
- Eliminates duplicate work via task management

**Example:**
- Session 1 records "API v1 deprecated".
- Session 2 (days later) queries and automatically uses v2.

> *This software does not send any data to external networks. We NEVER collect any data or usage statistics. Please use it with complete security.*

## Why Use sqlew?

### 🧠 Organizational Memory
Traditional code analysis like git tells you **WHAT** is done, sqlew adds **WHY** and **HOW** on it:
- **Decisions** → WHY it was changed
- **Constraints** → HOW should it be written
- **Tasks** → WHAT needs to be done

### ⚡ Token Efficiency
**60-75% token reduction** in multi-session projects through structured data storage and selective querying.

### 🎯 Key Features
- **5 Specialized Tools**: decisions, tasks, files, constraints, stats (config tool removed)
- **Parameter Validation**: Typo detection, required/optional markers, helpful error messages
- **Metadata-Driven**: Tag, layer, scope, and version everything
- **Decision Context**: Document WHY with rationale, alternatives, and trade-offs
- **Task Dependencies**: Blocking relationships with circular detection
- **Auto-File Tracking**: Zero-token task management via file watching
- **Smart Review Detection**: Quality-based auto-transition to `waiting_review`
- **Auto-Stale Detection**: Tasks auto-transition when idle
- **Weekend-Aware Cleanup**: Smart retention during weekends
- **Batch Operations**: Process up to 50 items atomically

See [docs/TASK_OVERVIEW.md](docs/TASK_OVERVIEW.md) and [docs/DECISION_CONTEXT.md](docs/DECISION_CONTEXT.md) for details.

## Installation

### Requirements
- Node.js 18.0.0 or higher
- npm or npx

### Quick Install

on `.mcp.json` in your project's root, add these lines:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sqlew": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["sqlew"]
    }
  }
}
```
**Recommend to restart claude after initialize**

The first time, sqlew install custom agents and initialize database. Custom agents are not loaded in this time. Please exit claude once, and restart claude again.

It's Ready!

**⚠️Note**: Global install (`npm install -g`) is **not recommended** because sqlew requires an independent settings per project. Each project should maintain its own context database in `.sqlew/sqlew.db`.

**Custom database path:** Add path as argument: `"args": ["sqlew", "/path/to/db.db"]`
**Default location:** `.sqlew/sqlew.db`

### Jetbrains Junie AI

**⚠️ Not Supported:** Junie AI cannot use relative paths in MCP server configurations, which makes it incompatible with sqlew's project-based database model. Each project requires its own isolated database at `.sqlew/sqlew.db`, but Junie AI's global MCP configuration cannot handle per-project database paths.

## Configuration

### Optional Config File

On first run, `.sqlew/config.toml` will be created for persistent settings:

```toml
[database]
path = ".sqlew/custom.db"

[autodelete]
ignore_weekend = true
message_hours = 48
```

Also `.sqlew/config.example.toml` is created for reference.

**Settings Priority:** CLI args > config.toml > database defaults

See [docs/CONFIGURATION.md](docs/CONFIGURATION.md) for all options and validation rules.

## Quick Start

install it, launch claude, exit claude and launch Claude again.

### Basic Usage

You'll never need to call it manually, I recommend to call this tool via prompt.

```
read sqlew usecases, and plan implementation of feature X using sqlew.
```

or invoke Specialized Agent

```
plan implementation of feature X with @agent-scrum-master.
```

Specialized Agents use sqlew more efficiently.

## Specialized Agents

sqlew provides three specialized agents for efficient multi-agent coordination in Claude Code:

| Agent | Purpose | Token Cost | Use When |
|-------|---------|------------|----------|
| **Scrum Master** | Multi-agent coordination, task management, sprint planning | 12KB/conversation | Coordinating complex features, managing dependencies, tracking progress |
| **Researcher** | Query decisions, analyze patterns, investigate context | 14KB/conversation | Understanding past decisions, onboarding new members, sprint retrospectives |
| **Architect** | Document decisions, enforce constraints, maintain standards | 20KB/conversation | Making architectural choices, establishing rules, validating compliance |

### Detailed Installation

**By default, all three specialized agents are automatically installed** to your project's `.claude/agents/` directory on first run.

To disable specific agents, create `.sqlew/config.toml`:

```toml
[agents]
scrum_master = true   # Coordination specialist (12KB)
researcher = false    # Disable this agent
architect = true      # Documentation specialist (20KB)
```

**Note**: Set an agent to `false` in the config file to prevent it from being installed.

**Usage**: Invoke agents with the `@` prefix: `@sqlew-scrum-master`, `@sqlew-researcher`, `@sqlew-architect`

**Recommendation**: Use all three agents together - they're complementary specialists (46KB total).

**Token Optimization** (if needed): Disable unused agents in config.
Savings: Scrum + Architect = 32KB (30%) | Scrum only = 12KB (74%)

**See [docs/SPECIALIZED_AGENTS.md](docs/SPECIALIZED_AGENTS.md) for complete installation guide, usage examples, and customization.**

### Available Tools

| Tool | Purpose | Example Use |
|------|---------|------------|
| **decision** | Record choices and reasons | "We chose PostgreSQL" |
| **constraint** | Define rules | "DO NOT use raw SQL, use ORM" |
| **task** | Track work | "Implement feature X" |
| **file** | Track changes | "Modified auth.ts" |
| **stats** | Database metrics | Get layer summary |
